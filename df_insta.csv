You must have heard of things like India's Cleanest city or the Greenest city blah blah...But where is India's Pet Friendly City ?

Well! CollegeTips have decided to upgrade every city into safest place for your constant fellow amigo.'

In this campaign we are going to create an awareness among people to make their city a Pet friendly one.

As the pets in our country get teased a lot by some creepy people who are not sensitive towards Animals. Also, Many pets die of Starvation due to shortage of food. CollegeTips is going to help the pets by providing them food , shelter/safe environment, any kind of treatment they need related to their health.

So, Join us in helping these pets and provide them with all the love and care that they need.

.

College Tips presents DIGITAL LITERACY COURSE FOR PARENTS‍‍‍
.
.
If you want to make your parent's life easy and happening, So here's something for you.
.
.
But, First think about it!
.
.
1.Do they know how to call an ola or uber to their rescue when in need ? 
2.Are Paytm , Phone Pe , Google pay their first to pay the bills ? 
3.Do they use google maps to locate an address? 
4.Have they ever for once booked tickets on their own through IRCTC ? 
5.Have they preferred ordering food online just like you do ?
6.Have they been using Netflix or YouTube to watch their favourite movies or Gaana , Spotify to listen and dance to their choicest music ?
7.Have they shopped online from Flipkart or Amazon as of yet or still a traditional shopper ? 
8.You still manage the apps on their phone or they know how too ?
9.Have they been reacting skootish by the name of OTP and emails? 
10.And what about they recharging their phone or DTH bill every month ? We suppose you don’t do that right ?
.
.
We already know the answer,  So you don't have to worry.
.
.
Just visit CollegeTips.in  and subscribe Digital literacy course for your parents. And that too for Free.
.
.
Under this course we will make your parents understand all the above mentioned things with ease and in their preferred language through our audio and video tutorials.
.
.
So that we can get rid of their digital dependency on us for smaller things.
.
.
Last but not the least, tell us that,
If someday your parents surprise you by ordering your favourite food on Zomato , and pay via Paytm.
And they tell you,
after long time they have listened to their good old songs on gaana app and saw their favourite movie on Amazon prime.
How will you feel...?
.
.
Want to live this feeling...What are you waiting for.
.
.
Just go and subscribe to CollegeTips.in and gift them a  independent digital life.
.
.
And if you are still thinking only using Whatsapp and Facebook is being digitally literate... Then you are wrong.!!
.
Thanks
